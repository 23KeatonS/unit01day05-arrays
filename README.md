1. `ThreeArrayProduct.java`

Given an array `a` of integers of length 3, print the product of all the elements.

`a` | printed output 
---|---
[2, 1, 3] | 6
[4, 0, 3] | 0
[2, 2, 2] | 8

2. `ThreeArrayRange.java`

Given an array `a` of integers of length 3, print the range of the elements. That is, the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.

`a` | printed output 
---|---
[2, 1, 3] | 2
[4, 0, 3] | 4
[2, 2, 2] | 0

3. `ImmutableSort.java`

Given an array `a` of integers of length 3, create a new array with the same elements as `a`, except now in ascending order. The original array `a` should not be modified.

`a` before | `a` after | contents of new array
---|--- | ---
[2, 1, 3] | [2, 1, 3] | [1, 2, 3]
[4, 0, 3] | [4, 0, 3] | [0, 3, 4]
[2, 2, 2] | [2, 2, 2] | [2, 2, 2]

4. `MutableSort.java`

Given an array `a` of integers of length 3, modify `a` so that it contains the same elements, but now they're in ascending order.

`a` before | `a` after 
---|--- 
[2, 1, 3] | [1, 2, 3]
[4, 0, 3] | [0, 3, 4]
[2, 2, 2] | [2, 2, 2]
